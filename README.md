# Copilot Prompt Crafting

A simple page in Business Central, used for testing System Prompts and User Prompts against Azure OpenAI Services.

## Getting Started

1. Build and install the app in your BC SaaS environment.
1. Search for the page "Copilot Prompt Crafting Setup" in Business Central, and open it.

If you have crafted some nice prompts, you can save them to the database by clicking "Save to History".
You can later retrieve them by clicking "Load from History".

## Background

This app was built during the BC AI Hackathon 2024, due to the lack of access to Azure OpenAI Studio.
